<h2>AJAX: How to Handle Bookmarks and Back Buttons</h2>
<p>by <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1388">Brad
Neuberg</a><br />
MM/DD/2005</p>
<h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>This article presents an open source JavaScript library that
finally brings bookmarking and back button support to AJAX
applications. By the end of this tutorial developers will have a
solution to an AJAX problem that not even <a href=
"http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> or <a href=
"http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> possesses: robust, usable
bookmarking and back and forward behavior that works exactly like
the rest of the web.</p>
<p>"AJAX: How to Handle Bookmarks and Back Buttons" discusses the
significant issues that AJAX applications currently face with
bookmarks and the back button; delivers an open source library created
exclusively for this article that solves these problems; and
presents two complete working examples.</p>
<h3><a name="problem" id="problem">The Problem</a></h3>
<p>Bookmarks and the back button work great for traditional,
multi-page web applications. As users surf web sites, their browsers'
location bars update with new URLs that can be pasted into emails or
bookmarked for later use. The back and forward buttons also
function correctly and shuffle users between the pages they have
visited.</p>
<p>AJAX applications are unusual, however, in that they are
sophisticated programs that live within a single web page. Browsers
were not built for such beasts &#8212; they are trapped in the Stone Age
when web applications involved pulling completely fresh pages on
every mouse click.</p>
<p>In such AJAX software as Gmail, the browser's location bar stays
exactly the same as users select functions and change the
application's state, making bookmarking into specific application
views impossible. Further, if users press their back buttons to
"undo" a previous action, they will find to their surprise that the
browser completely leaves the web page.</p>
<h3><a name="solution" id="solution">The Solution</a></h3>
<p>The Really Simply History framework (RSH), created exclusively
for this article, solves these issues. RSH is an open source
JavaScript library that brings bookmarking and control over the
back and forward buttons to AJAX applications. RSH is under a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_License">BSD license</a>,
making it freely usable by both open source and commercial systems;
is currently in beta; and works with Firefox 1.0, Netscape 7+, and
Internet Explorer 6+. Safari is not currently supported <a href=
"#footnote1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Several AJAX frameworks currently exist <a href=
"#footnote2">[2]</a> that help with bookmarking and history issues;
however, all of these frameworks suffer from several important bugs
<a href="#footnote3">[3]</a> due to their implementations. Further,
many AJAX history frameworks are monolithically bundled into larger
libraries, such as <a href="http://www.backbase.com/">Backbase</a>
and <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>; these
frameworks introduce significantly different programming models for
AJAX applications, forcing developers to adopt entirely new
approaches to gain history functionality.</p>
<p>In contrast, RSH is a simple module that can be included into
existing AJAX systems. Further, the Really Simple History library
uses techniques <a href="#footnote4">[4]</a> to avoid the bugs that
affect other history frameworks.</p>
<p>Really Simple History is straightforward and consists of two
JavaScript classes, named <code>DhtmlHistory</code> and
<code>HistoryStorage</code>. This article provides two full
examples and explanations of working with both classes.</p>
<p>The <code>DhtmlHistory</code> class provides a history
abstraction for AJAX applications. AJAX pages <code>add()</code>
history events to the browser, specifying new locations and
associated history data. The <code>DhtmlHistory</code> class
updates the browser's current URL using an anchor hash, such as
<code>#new-location</code>, and associates history data with this
new URL. AJAX applications register themselves as history
listeners, and as the user navigates with the back and forward
buttons, history events are fired that provide the browser's new
location and any history data that was persisted with an
<code>add()</code> call.</p>
<p>The second class, named <code>HistoryStorage</code>, allows
developers to store an arbitrary amount of saved history data. In
normal pages when a user navigates to a new web site, the browser
unloads and clears out all application and JavaScript state on the
web page; if the user returns using the back button, all data is
lost. The <code>HistoryStorage</code> class solves this problem
through an API containing simple hash table methods such as
<code>put()</code>, <code>get()</code>, and <code>hasKey()</code>.
These methods allow developers to store an arbitrary amount of data
after the user has left a web page; when the user returns using the
back button the data can be accessed through the
<code>HistoryStorage</code> class.</p>
<h3><a name="example1" id="example1">Example 1</a></h3>
<p>Let's jump right in with a simple example.</p>
<p>First, any page that wishes to use the Really Simple History
framework must include the following script blocks:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;!-- Load the Really Simple 
     History framework --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
        src="../lib/history/serializer.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
        src="../lib/history/historyStorage.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
        src="../lib/history/dhtmlHistory.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>DHTML History applications must also include a special file
named <i>blank.html</i> in the same directory as their AJAX
web page; this file is bundled with the Really Simple History
framework and is needed by Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The RSH framework creates a global object named
<code>dhtmlHistory</code> that is the entry point for manipulating
the browser's history. The first step in working with
<code>dhtmlHistory</code> is initializing the object after the page
has finished loading:</p>
<pre>
<code>window.onload = initialize;
    
function initialize() {
  // initialize the DHTML History
  // framework
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
</code>
</pre>
<p>Next, developers use the <code>dhtmlHistory.addListener()</code>
method to subscribe to history change events. This method takes a
single JavaScript callback function that will receive two arguments
whenever a DHTML history change event has occurred: the new
location of the page, and any optional history data that might be
associated with this event:</p>
<pre>
<code>window.onload = initialize;
    
function initialize() {
  // initialize the DHTML History
  // framework
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  <em>// subscribe to DHTML history change
  // events
  dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);</em>
</code>
</pre>
<p>The <code>historyChange()</code> method:</p>
<pre>
<code>/** Our callback to receive history change
     events. */
function historyChange(newLocation, 
                       historyData) {
  debug("A history change has occurred: "
        + "newLocation="+newLocation
        + ", historyData="+historyData, 
        true);
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>Note that the <code>debug()</code> method is a utility function
defined in this example's <a href=
"examples/simple/src/simple-src.html">source file</a>.
<code>debug()</code> simply prints a message into the web page; the
second boolean argument, <code>true</code> in the code above,
controls whether all pre-existing messages are cleared before the
new debug message is printed.</p>
<p>A developer adds history events using the <code>add()</code>
method. Adding a history event involves specifying a new location
for the history change, such as <code>"edit:SomePage"</code>, as
well as providing an optional <code>historyData</code> value that
will be stored with this event:</p>
<pre>
<code>window.onload = initialize;
    
function initialize() {
  // initialize the DHTML History
  // framework
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  // subscribe to DHTML history change
  // events
  dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
      
  // if this is the first time we have
  // loaded the page...
  if (dhtmlHistory.isFirstLoad()) {
    debug("Adding values to browser "
          + "history", false);
    <em>// start adding history
    dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", 
                     "Hello World Data");
    dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
    dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
      
    var complexObject = new Object();
    complexObject.value1 = 
                  "This is the first value";
    complexObject.value2 = 
                  "This is the second data";
    complexObject.value3 = new Array();
    complexObject.value3[0] = "array 1";
    complexObject.value3[1] = "array 2";
      
    dhtmlHistory.add("complexObject", 
                     complexObject);</em>
</code>
</pre>
<p>Immediately after <code>add()</code> is called the new location
will be shown to the user in the browser's URL toolbar as an anchor
value. For example, after calling
<code>dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", "Hello World Data")</code> for
an AJAX web page that lives at
<code>http://codinginparadise.org/my_ajax_app</code>, the user
would see the following in their browser's URL toolbar:</p>
<pre>
<code>http://codinginparadise.org/my_ajax_app#helloworld</code>
</pre>
<p>They can then bookmark this page; later, if they use this
bookmark, your AJAX application can read the
<code>#helloworld</code> value and use it to initialize the web
page. Location values after the hash are URL encoded and decoded
transparently by the Really Simple History framework.</p>
<p><code>historyData</code> is useful for saving more complicated
state with an AJAX location change than what can easily fit on a
URL. It is an optional value that can be any JavaScript type, such
as a <code>Number</code>, <code>String</code>, or
<code>Object</code>. One example use of this is saving all of the
text in a rich text editor, for example, if the user navigates away
from the page. When a user navigates back to this location, the
browser will return the object to the history change listener.</p>
<p>Developers can provide a full JavaScript object for
<code>historyData</code>, with nested objects and arrays
representing complex state; whatever is allowed by <a href=
"http://www.crockford.com/JSON/index.html">JSON (JavaScript Object
Notation</a>) is allowed in the history data, including simple data
types and the <code>null</code> type. References to DOM objects and
scriptable browser objects like <code>XmlHttpRequest</code>,
however, are not saved. Note that <code>historyData</code> is not
persisted with bookmarks, and disappears if the browser is closed;
if the browser's cache is cleared; or if the user erases their
history.</p>
<p>The last step in working with <code>dhtmlHistory</code> is the
<code>isFirstLoad()</code> method. In some browsers, if you
navigate to a web page, jump to a different page, and then press
the back button to return to the initial site, the first page will
completely reload and fire an <code>onload</code> event. This can
create havoc with code that wants to initialize the page in a
certain way the first time it loads, but not on subsequent reloads
of the page. The <code>isFirstLoad()</code> method makes it
possible to differentiate between the very first time a web page
has loaded versus a false load event fired if the user navigates
back to a saved web page in their browser's history.</p>
<p>In the example code, we only want to add history events the
first time a page has loaded; if the user presses the back button
to return to the page after it has loaded, we do not want to re-add
all the history events:</p>
<pre>
<code>window.onload = initialize;
    
function initialize() {
  // initialize the DHTML History
  // framework
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  // subscribe to DHTML history change
  // events
  dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
      
  <em>// if this is the first time we have
  // loaded the page...
  if (dhtmlHistory.isFirstLoad()) {</em>
    debug("Adding values to browser "
          + "history", false);
    // start adding history
    dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", 
                     "Hello World Data");
    dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
    dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
      
    var complexObject = new Object();
    complexObject.value1 = 
                  "This is the first value";
    complexObject.value2 = 
                  "This is the second data";
    complexObject.value3 = new Array();
    complexObject.value3[0] = "array 1";
    complexObject.value3[1] = "array 2";
      
    dhtmlHistory.add("complexObject", 
                     complexObject);
</code>
</pre>
<p>Let's move on to using the <code>HistoryStorage</code> class.
Like <code>DhtmlHistory</code>, <code>HistoryStorage</code> exposes
its functionality through a single, global object named
<code>historyStorage</code>. This object has several methods that
simulate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtable">hash
table</a>, such as <code>put(keyName, keyValue)</code>,
<code>get(keyName)</code>, and <code>hasKey(keyName)</code>. Key
names must be strings, while key values can be sophisticated
JavaScript objects or even strings filled with XML. In our example
source code, we <code>put()</code> simple XML into
<code>historyStorage</code> the first time the page is loaded:</p>
<pre>
<code>window.onload = initialize;
    
function initialize() {
  // initialize the DHTML History
  // framework
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  // subscribe to DHTML history change
  // events
  dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
      
  // if this is the first time we have
  // loaded the page...
  if (dhtmlHistory.isFirstLoad()) {
    debug("Adding values to browser "
          + "history", false);
    // start adding history
    dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", 
                     "Hello World Data");
    dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
    dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
      
    var complexObject = new Object();
    complexObject.value1 = 
                  "This is the first value";
    complexObject.value2 = 
                  "This is the second data";
    complexObject.value3 = new Array();
    complexObject.value3[0] = "array 1";
    complexObject.value3[1] = "array 2";
      
    dhtmlHistory.add("complexObject", 
                     complexObject);
                     
    <em>// cache some values in the history
    // storage
    debug("Storing key 'fakeXML' into " 
          + "history storage", false);
    var fakeXML = 
      '&lt;?xml version="1.0" '
      +      'encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;'
      +      '&lt;foobar&gt;'
      +         '&lt;foo-entry/&gt;'
      +      '&lt;/foobar&gt;';
    historyStorage.put("fakeXML", fakeXML);</em>
  } 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Afterwards, if the user navigates away from the page and then
returns through their back button, we can extract our stored value
using the <code>get()</code> method or check for its existence
using <code>hasKey()</code>:</p>
<pre>
<code>window.onload = initialize;
    
function initialize() {
  // initialize the DHTML History
  // framework
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  // subscribe to DHTML history change
  // events
  dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
      
  // if this is the first time we have
  // loaded the page...
  if (dhtmlHistory.isFirstLoad()) {
    debug("Adding values to browser "
          + "history", false);
    // start adding history
    dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", 
                     "Hello World Data");
    dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
    dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
      
    var complexObject = new Object();
    complexObject.value1 = 
                  "This is the first value";
    complexObject.value2 = 
                  "This is the second data";
    complexObject.value3 = new Array();
    complexObject.value3[0] = "array 1";
    complexObject.value3[1] = "array 2";
      
    dhtmlHistory.add("complexObject", 
                     complexObject);
                     
    // cache some values in the history
    // storage
    debug("Storing key 'fakeXML' into " 
          + "history storage", false);
    var fakeXML = 
      '&lt;?xml version="1.0" '
      +      'encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;'
      +      '&lt;foobar&gt;'
      +         '&lt;foo-entry/&gt;'
      +      '&lt;/foobar&gt;';
    historyStorage.put("fakeXML", fakeXML);
  } 
  
  <em>// retrieve our values from the history
  // storage
  var savedXML = 
              historyStorage.get("fakeXML");
  savedXML = prettyPrintXml(savedXML);
  var hasKey = 
           historyStorage.hasKey("fakeXML");
  var message =
    "historyStorage.hasKey('fakeXML')="
    + hasKey + "&lt;br&gt;"
    + "historyStorage.get('fakeXML')=&lt;br&gt;"
    + savedXML;
  debug(message, false);</em>
}
</code>
</pre>
<p><code>prettyPrintXml()</code> is a utility method defined in the
<a href="examples/simple/src/simple-src.html">full example source
code</a>; this function prepares the simple XML to be displayed to
the web page for debugging.</p>
<p>Note that data is only persisted in terms of this page's
history; if the browser is closed, or if the user opens a new
window and types in the AJAX application's address again, this
history data is not available to the new web page. History data is
only persisted in terms of the back and forward buttons and
disappears when the user closes the browser or clears their
cache.</p>
<p>Our simple example is now finished. <a href=
"examples/simple/simple.html">Demo it</a> or see the full source
code: <a href="examples/simple/src"><i>simple/</i></a>, <a href=
"examples/simple/src/simple-src.html"><i>simple.html</i></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="example2" id="example2">Example 2</a></h3>
<p>The second example highlights advanced use of the
<code>DhtmlHistory</code> and <code>HistoryStorage</code> classes
in a real world application. In the second application we create an
AJAX web page with a series of topic links; when topics are
selected, their contents are remotely loaded and shown on the
right-hand side of the page without performing a full page
refresh:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://localhost/resources/advanced_screencast/advanced_screencast.html">
<img alt=
"Advanced Example Screenshot, showing menu of topics on the left and selected topic content on the right"
src=
"http://localhost/resources/advanced_screencast/advanced_screencast_thumbnail.gif" /></a><br />

<i>Figure 1. Advanced Example Screenshot (Click for Screen cast of
User Interacting With Example)</i></p>
<p>The example is somewhat arbitrary and could be created with
other, simpler technologies, such as using an iframe and hyperlinks
that target the iframe. This example, however, is straightforward
enough to illustrate how to use the Really Simple History API in an
advanced way for controlling history, providing bookmarking, and
caching state that is expensive to reload from the server. It is
meant to provide cut and paste code for more advanced AJAX
applications.</p>
<p>The example application consists of four major files: <a href=
"examples/advanced/src/advanced-src.html"><i>advanced.html</i></a>,
<a href=
"examples/advanced/src/advanced-src.css.html"><i>advanced.css</i></a>,
<a href=
"examples/advanced/src/advanced-src.js.html"><i>advanced.js</i></a>,
and <a href=
"examples/advanced/src/topics-src.xml.html"><i>topics.xml</i></a>.
We also use three frameworks to accelerate development: the
<code>DhtmlHistory</code> and <code>HistoryStorage</code> APIs; the
<a href="http://cross-browser.com/">X DHTML Library</a>, an open
source toolkit that eases cross-browser DHTML; and <a href=
"http://sarissa.sourceforge.net/doc/">Sarissa</a>, an open source
API for working with <code>XmlHttpRequest</code> and XML.</p>
<p>As users select topics in the left hand menu, we fetch the
topic's contents in the background and use the
<code>DhtmlHistory</code> API to record bookmarkable history. When
the page is initially loaded, we retrieve the list of available
topics from an XML file and cache them locally using the
<code>HistoryStorage</code> API, using this XML file to build up
our user interface dynamically.</p>
<p>A complete walkthrough of the advanced example is beyond the
scope of this article; however, I have created a blog post that
breaks down this example piece by piece titled <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2005/09/ajax-how-to-handle-bookmarks-and-back.html">

<h3><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>You have now learned to use the Really Simple History API to
make your AJAX applications respect bookmarks and the back and
forward buttons, and have two full examples that can be used as
scaffolding for creating your own applications. I look forward to
seeing your AJAX inventions out in the wild, complete with
bookmarks and history support.</p>

<p>The following major issues affect all of the AJAX history
libraries I have evaluated, other than the Really Simple History
framework.</p>
<p>First, some history frameworks, such as Dojo, use JavaScript
objects to store an internal representation of the state of an AJAX
application's history; unfortunately, browsers completely clear out
all JavaScript objects when a user leaves a page. If a user
interacts with an AJAX application, navigates to Google, and then
returns to their original AJAX page, the AJAX history framework's
internal state is erased and becomes confused.</p>
<p>Another bug that affects many frameworks is that they do not
differentiate between the first time a page truly loads versus
"fake" page loads. In many browsers, when a user first loads an
AJAX application, the browser will throw an <code>onload</code>
event. Later, if the user navigates to a different web site and
then returns using the back button, the browser will throw a new
<code>onload</code> event even though the page already loaded the
first time. Many subtle bugs can occur in AJAX history frameworks
unless these two kinds of load events are differentiated.</p>
<p>Finally, I have not seen an AJAX history framework that will
detect when a user has manually entered a new hash location in
Internet Explorer.</p>

techniques is beyond the scope of this article. The primary
mechanism, however, is achieved using <code>DhtmlHistory</code>, a
JavaScript class that allows developers to store history state
after the browser has left a web page. This data is persisted
between page loads using the auto save capability of web forms; see
my blog post <a href=
"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2005/08/ajax-tutorial-saving-session-across.html">
"AJAX Tutorial: Saving Session Across Page Loads Without Cookies,
On The Client Side"</a> for implementation details.
<code>DhtmlHistory</code> wraps the auto save trick with an easy
hash table API for developers, and the main RSH framework then uses
the <code>DhtmlHistory</code> class to implement stateless tracking
of history; variables that allow the detection of fake versus real
page load events; and more.</li>
