<p>This document is a strawman proposal for a very simple browser-supported
API for AJAX applications to support bookmarking and the back and forward buttons. 
It is meant to be implemented by both browser manufacturers as well as developers
creating emulation libraries to provide such support.
It is in alpha draft form and is open to comments. It's operating
principles are Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) and to create APIs that work in the real world.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>AJAX applications are essentially entire web applications contained within a single
web page. By default, they do not work with browsers' bookmarking and back and forward
button capabilities. There is no way for a user to bookmark the particular state of an AJAX
web page, such as after a search request, and pressing the back or forward buttons after
working with an AJAX application will cause the browser to completely leave the AJAX web page,
confusing users and creating usability problems.</p>

<p>In order to truly be effective AJAX applications must support these abilities. As a user
works with an AJAX page, selecting functions and changing the system's state, the browser's URL
location bar should change to a degree necessary for the user to bookmark
the current state or send it to friends via email. Every change to the browser's location while within
the AJAX page should be saved into the history, so that as users press the back and forward buttons
the browser will jump between the various locations that have been recorded. Developers should have full
control recording history changes while within their AJAX web page; a developer should simply be able
to provide a new in-page history location and history data. When a history change occurs, the developer
should receive a callback with the new location and any associated history data.</p>

<p>An AJAX history API should not force programmers to interpret history changes in a particular way; it
should completely divorce network activity from in-page history changes. In AJAX systems, network activity
through XmlHttpRequest or publish-subscribe APIs are not necessarily appropriate to be placed into the
browser's DHTML history; in contrast, user activity that produces no network activity is sometimes important
to store into the AJAX history.</p>

<p>When a developer receives a history change event, they should have the full power to interpret it in a way
that is appropriate for their application. Some AJAX applications will use the back and forward buttons
as simulated Undo/Redo systems, while others will only record higher-level user events into the history
and bookmark systems. The decision of how to interpret history change events must be left to the application
developer; an AJAX history API should only give the ability to intercept in-page history events and not
interpret the meaning of these events.</p>

<p>Developers are also not interested in the manner in which a history change event occurs; i.e. whether
it was through the back button, the forward button, by going through a browser's list of history pages,
etc. Programmers are simply interested in being notified of the existence of an in-page history change.</p>   

<p>A major requirement for this API is that it can be emulated through shims for browsers that do
not natively support the API. This requirement significantly influences the
shape of the API we can create, since most browser's do not allow emulation libraries to extend
the available native event types, add methods to the <code>history</code> object, etc.
Emulation shims are not expected to provide all the features of this API; where possible, developers
are given simple methods to query on whether a particular feature is supported.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Really Simply History introduces the notion of an in-page DHTML history that is separate from a browser's standard
cross-page history object. It does this by adding a new member to the <code>window</code> object named 
<code>dhtmlHistory</code>:</p>

<code>window.dhtmlHistory</code>

<p>Since the <code>window</code> object is the root level object and is implicit, developers can
leave off the <code>window</code> reference when referring to the <code>dhtmlHistory</code> object.</p>

<p>The <code>dhtmlHistory</code> object has the following primary methods:</p>

<pre><code>addListener(callback)
removeListener(callback)
add(newLocation, historyData)
hasHistory()
</code></pre>

<p>It also has the following support methods that are useful in some contexts:</p>

<pre><code>isInternational()
supportsHistoryData()
getVersion()
</code></pre>

<p>Let's start by seeing how a programmer would actually use this API. This is in contrast
to usual specifications which are full of hairy context free grammars
and obtuse verbiage; this should keep us honest and ensure we actually have a
usable API. Here is the complete
code for an example usage of the <code>dhtmlHistory</code> API; we will break down and discuss
each piece:</p>

<pre><code><html>
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
         function initialize() {
            // subscribe to DHTML history change
            // events
            dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
            
            // if this is the first time we have
            // loaded the page...
            if (dhtmlHistory.hasHistory() == false) {
               // start adding history
               dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", "Hello World Data");
               dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
               dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
            
               var historyData = new Object();
               historyData.value1 = "This is the first value";
               historyData.value2 = "This is the second data";
            
               dhtmlHistory.add("moreStuff", historyData);
            } 
         }
         
         /** Our callback to receive history change
             events. */
         function historyChange(newLocation, historyData) {
            alert("A history change has occured: newLocation="+newLocation
                  + ", historyData="+historyData);
         }
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body onload="initialize()"&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A developer begins by subscribing to DHTML history change events after the page is finished
loading, using the <code>addListener</code> method. This method takes a single argument, which
is a JavaScript callback function. The callback function will receive two arguments whenever a
DHTML history change event has occurred: the new location of the page, and any optional history 
data that might be associated with this event:</p>

<pre><code><html>
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
         function initialize() {
            // subscribe to DHTML history change
            // events
            <em>dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);</em>
            
            // if this is the first time we have
            // loaded the page...
            if (dhtmlHistory.hasHistory() == false) {
               // start adding history
               dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", "Hello World Data");
               dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
               dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
            
               var historyData = new Object();
               historyData.value1 = "This is the first value";
               historyData.value2 = "This is the second data";
            
               dhtmlHistory.add("moreStuff", historyData);
            } 
         }
         
         <em>/** Our callback to receive history change
             events. */
         function historyChange(newLocation, historyData) {
            alert("A history change has occured: newLocation="+newLocation
                  + ", historyData="+historyData);
         }</em>
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body onload="initialize()"&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A developer add's history events using the <code>add()</code> method. Adding a history
event involves specifying a new location for the history change, such as "edit:SomePage", as well
as providing an optional <code>historyData</code> value that will be stored with this event:</p>

<pre><code><html>
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
         function initialize() {
            // subscribe to DHTML history change
            // events
            dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
            
            // if this is the first time we have
            // loaded the page...
            if (dhtmlHistory.hasHistory() == false) {
               <em>// start adding history
               dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", "Hello World Data");
               dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
               dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
            
               var historyData = new Object();
               historyData.value1 = "This is the first value";
               historyData.value2 = "This is the second data";
            
               dhtmlHistory.add("moreStuff", historyData);</em>
            } 
         }
         
         /** Our callback to receive history change
             events. */
         function historyChange(newLocation, historyData) {
            alert("A history change has occured: newLocation="+newLocation
                  + ", historyData="+historyData);
         }
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body onload="initialize()"&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The new location will be shown to the user in the browser's URL toolbar, as an anchor value. For
example, after calling <code>dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", "Hello World Data")</code> for an
AJAX web page that lives at <code>http://codinginparadise.org/my_ajax_app</code>, the user would
see the following in their browser's URL toolbar:</p>

<pre><code>http://codinginparadise.org/my_ajax_app#helloworld</code></pre>

<p>They could then bookmark this page; later, if they use this bookmark, your AJAX application can read
the <code>#helloworld</code> value and use it to initialize the web page. Location values after the
hash will be URL encoded and decoded transparently by the <code>dhtmlHistory</code> framework.</p>

<p><code>historyData</code> is useful for saving more complicated state with an AJAX location change than what
can easily fit on to a URL. It is an optional value that can be any JavaScript type, such as a Number,
String, or Object. One example use of this is saving all of the text in a rich text editor,
for example, if the user navigates away from the page. When a user navigates back to this location, the 
browser will return the object
to a history change listener.</p>

<p>Developers can provide a full JavaScript object for <code>historyData</code>, with nested objects and
arrays representing complex state; whatever is allowed by <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> is allowed
in the history data, including simple data types and the <code>null</code> type. References to DOM objects and scriptable browser objects
like XmlHttpRequest, however, will not be saved. Note that <code>historyData</code> is not saved with bookmarks, and disappears
when the browser is closed, or if the browser's cache or history are cleared or full.</p> 

<div class="issue">
   Issue: Is there a size limit for the location change value? How about for history data?
</div>

<p>Note that most emulation shims for this API, as opposed to native support in the browser,
will probably not have the ability to return <code>historyData</code>; this is due to the fact
that saving history data after the browser has left a page is very difficult and unreliable from
within an emulation library. To create code that
is compatible for all browsers that use this API, whether through native support or emulation, developers
can either choose to not use history data:</p>

<pre><code>dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld");
...
function historyChange(newLocation) {
   alert("History change, newLocation="+newLocation);
}
</code></pre> 

<p>Or can choose to use the <code>supportsHistoryData()</code> method, which returns true if a browser
can store history data and false if it can not:</p>

<pre><code>if (dhtmlHistory.supportsHistoryData()) {
   dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", someData);
}
else {
   dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The last step in working with <code>dhtmlHistory</code> is the <code>hasHistory()</code> method.
In some browsers, if you navigate to a web page, jump to another web site, and then press the back button
to return to the initial web site, the initial web page will completely reload and fire an onload event. 
This can create havoc with code that wants to initialize the page in a certain way only the first time 
it is loaded; afterwards, if there is history or certain data has already been loaded from a remote 
web server, a
developer wishes to not repeat a certain action. The <code>hasHistory()</code> method makes it possible
to differentiate between the very first time a web
page has loaded versus after it has already been loaded and possibly contains history data. As soon as a
page has loaded the first time it has DHTML history, namely the single page itself. In the example code, we
only want to add test history events the first time a page has loaded; if the user presses the back button
to return to the first page, we do not want to re-add all the history events:</p>

<pre><code><html>
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
         function initialize() {
            // subscribe to DHTML history change
            // events
            dhtmlHistory.addListener(historyChange);
            
            // if this is the first time we have
            // loaded the page...
            <em>if (dhtmlHistory.hasHistory() == false) {
               // start adding history
               dhtmlHistory.add("helloworld", "Hello World Data");
               dhtmlHistory.add("foobar", 33);
               dhtmlHistory.add("boobah", true);
            
               var historyData = new Object();
               historyData.value1 = "This is the first value";
               historyData.value2 = "This is the second data";
            
               dhtmlHistory.add("moreStuff", historyData);
            }</em> 
         }
         
         /** Our callback to receive history change
             events. */
         function historyChange(newLocation, historyData) {
            alert("A history change has occured: newLocation="+newLocation
                  + ", historyData="+historyData);
         }
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body onload="initialize()"&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative method for subscribing to history change events is supported, using the
<code>onhistorychange</code> attribute directory on a document's <code>body</code> tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body onhistorychange="alert('history change')"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>A developer can register a callback using <code>onhistorychange</code> just as they would
using <code>addListener()</code>; note that using the <code>onhistorychange</code> method will
clear out any listeners added using <code>addListener()</code>.</p>

<p>Developers can use the <code>getVersion</code> method to find out which version of the
Really Simple History API is supported. The value returned should be the specification version as a string,
such as "0.01".</p>

<p>As a final note to implementors, history change events are fired from the 
following user actions; they are not fired for any other 
actions not on this list:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Pressing the back or forward buttons</li>
   <li>Choosing the page from a list of history URLs using a browser user-interface</li>
   <li>If the user is at an AJAX web page, and manually changes the hash value in the browser's
   location, a history change event will be fired with null <code>historyData</code></li>
   <li>If the user is at an AJAX web page, and chooses a bookmark that is on this web page that contains
   a new hash value, a history change event will be fired with null <code>historyData</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Issues</h2>

<h3>Text Encoding</h3>
<p>The default encoding for location values and JavaScript strings is UTF-8. The text encoding for 
emulation shims for browsers that do not natively support the DhtmlHistory API is
unspecified, however; internationalized values may not necessarily work in these browsers. The
<code>isInternational()</code> method is provided for programmers to query
whether the browser they are working with supports internationalization in the context of DHTML history:</p>

<pre><code>if (dhtmlHistory.isInternational()) {
   // store some UTF-8 string in our DHTML history
}
else {
   alert("This browser does not support internationalization");
}
</code></pre>    

<div class="issue">
   Issue: What is the default encoding for JavaScript
strings? Can the encoding be specified when creating
a JavaScript string like in Java?
</div>
<div class="issue">
   Issue: What is the default encoding for anchor values?

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h4><a name="use_w3c_events">Why Don't You Use W3C Events, the 
Native <code>History</code> Object, etc.?</a></h4>
<p>I have kept deep browser integration to a minimum to support browser emulation shims, which may
not be able to hook new event types into the browser through the W3C <code>addEventListener</code>,
or which may not have permission to add methods to the <code>history</code> object.</p>

<h4><a name="extend_history">Why Not Just Extend the <code>History</code> object?</a></h4>

<p>There really is a difference between the browser's <code>history</code> object and
<code>dhtmlHistory</code>. A web page has permission (and interest) in subscribing to history changes
within the context of its own document; if a user jumps from my AJAX application to Google, my application
is not interested in that. If the user jumps back from Google to my AJAX application, I <em>am</em> interested
in this. For this reason we separate out cross-page history from in-page history.</p>

<p>Extending the <code>history</code> object also creates trouble for browser emulation shims; 
see <a href="#use_w3c_events">Why Don't You Use W3C Events, the Native <code>History</code> Object, etc.</a>
for more information.</p>
